# Koodoo Software Engineer Technical Assessment ðŸ‘¾
 
### Introduction
Thanks for the chat and the chance to take part in the technical test.
Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
### The Solution
I've included a little UI to help you test.  It's not much, but it may be useful.
 
I was wondering if a tolerance value should have been added, or the ability highlight certain months that were "blips" without labeling the the account as variable - as long as the account proceeded on track. In the end I stuck to the task description.
